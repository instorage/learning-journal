## TIL

- I am learning how to interact more and more with forms, jquery and html.
- I learned about regex. Still trying to figure out how the hell to use it.
- I learned a little history of node.
- I learned how to make ajax calls using javascript
- I learned then() returns a promise
- I learned that even with special glasses. Staring at the sun hurts like a mofo.
- Last but not least. When time is of the essence. Yogurt and granola is an easy and quick breakfast to take to school.
