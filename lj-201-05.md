# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 5

## TIL

I am getting a lot more familiar with Events :) I think my big little win for me was being able to think an event to do without having to just research it on the webz. It was something simple but It's giving me a grasp on how to manipulate the DOM much better
I am learning some time management skills as well. Kind of forced to. I learned about flexbox so that's interesting in theory. I still dont quite get them but I'll get there.
