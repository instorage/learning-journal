# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 9

## TIL

What I am learning this time around is how to work with other people. Having to be ok with an idea not being implemented, or simply having to trust another individual to do something that might not be kind of how I'd like it, and being ok with that it can be difficult. Not being in complete control while at the same time trying to get to a final destination sometimes feels like running a 3 legged race with 4 people at the same time. Out of all of this, the most important thing is to do as much planning as possible. I am trying, I am not very good at it but I think I'll get it eventually
