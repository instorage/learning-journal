# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 4

## TIL

I feel I have learned so much, and at the same time I feel I know even less than when I started.
The main thing that I have (kind of) learned is events, I think that is the most significant thing. It is too complicated for me to say that I know it perfectly.

I figure out what the term callback means. And I am getting a little better at the DOM manipulation. I am also enjoying solving problems.

Events it's what's going to get me. I am getting distracted in class. I am getting to the point that I can't follow some of the thing Sam says. I think all I need is more practice
