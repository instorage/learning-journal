# Learning Journal 301 - Entry 09

## TIL

- I learned how to work with my team mates
- We figure out what we want to do with our project and learned how to work with our data
- I learned that some data can be a pain in the arse to work with, so I must be flexible and be willing to change course if the data is not friendly
- I learned how to take tests and do fairly descent in them.
