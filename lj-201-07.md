# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 7

## TIL

I think this is the 7th one right?! Main thing I learned, or at least I was reminded of is to talk my code with other people. If it wasn't for that, I would have not solve some issues I was having with my codez.
Apart from that. All about local storage, I didn't even know that was a thing.
I am starting to feel a little better regarding my code. :)
