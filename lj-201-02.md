# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 2

TIL
The last couple of days have been incredibly informative. I finally understand the difference between == and ===. I learned that I called type coercion
I learned the hard way that a prompt box outputs a string and if I need a number from that I need a parceInt()
I learned why is best practice to use single quotes on JS. Being because if I am going to insert HTML on JS, HTML is going to use double quotes. And it's going to make my life a lot easier.
I learned a lot of best practices regarding HTML. And that it is paramount to make the code user friendly and readable
I learned a lot of best practices in JS. Especially regarding flow and modularity.
Most importantly, I learned that I have a lot of bad practices that I need to fix and I don't know as much as I thought I did. Which makes me really excited :)
