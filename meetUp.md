I went to the Monday Night SeattleJS Hackers "Hack Night" in 8th and Olive

I had a good time seeing what people are doing.
There're was a speaker in one of the private rooms giving a talk about Angular vs React. (I think Angular sucks and React rules but that's me).

I talk to about 5 people. A lady named Jennifer, she was working on a portfolio piece to teach herself React. A woman called Christy, her computer broke so she was jotting away at a notebook trying to figure out some API calls for a portfolio piece. A really smart kid named Austin, also working on a portfolio piece. He was working working on WebPack, I didn't quite understand what that was but apparently it works with React. Some guy named David, he was working on an app to make chemical equations and reactions. I didn't get a good feeling about him. He wasn't the nicest guy in the room, coincidentally I think you might know him. He is apparently coming to Code Fellows, I think I saw him during project week 201. Finally I talk to a guy named Jack. He was working on visualizing voting data for the Washington State (another portfolio piece). He was kind of getting fed up with D3 and C3 (Data Visualization libraries) so I told him about ChartJS. Long story short, he was very happy with the tip bit.

From what I could tell, most people there were unemployed and/or transitioning to the field of tech. Makes me a little nervous about getting a job once I leave Code Fellows.
