# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 10

## TIL

What I learned this time around is, I guess, a little bit of what it feels to be a leader. Thursday was a day where we had to try and put the project together. I feel like my roll was more of empowering and helping where we needed to be help, instead of hovering and doing the work. It was more of giving direction and allowing the team to go through it. It was really cool. At least that's the way it felt.
