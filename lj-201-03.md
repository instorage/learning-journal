# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 3

## TIL

The main thing that I've learned since the last time I wrote something is that writing things down is really helpful before tackling any problem. It helps me a lot if I just write what I think the problem is suppose to be in my own words.

I learn not to think of function returns as a return but to think of the entire function as a value or just an output. Meaning that if I see something like `someFunc()[2]`, not to freak out.

I learned that objects are really annoying, but I need to learn how to live with them. (I can't wait to get to functional programming)

I guess most importantly of all, I learned the proper way to use "this" freaking elusive term that has baffled me since the beginning of time
