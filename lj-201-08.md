# Learning Journal 201 - Entry 8

## TIL

What did I learn this time around! I think that I need to pay more attention to my tests. I passed my exam for 301, YAY!!, but I missed some of the obvious questions GRRRR!!!
I am learning more about map reduce and filter. I think methods are going to come really in handy later on.
iifes, I didn't know about that but I think I do now so that's cool.
And I think the most beneficial thing I learned really all week is that GitHub has a place to put ideas for projects, and it's called... Projects :)
