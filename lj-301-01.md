# Learning Journal 301 - Entry 01

## TIL

- The newest thing I learned is the concept of SMACSS, which sounds kind of cool in theory but it's a pain in the arse. I'm sure I will like it once I get used to it but for now it's just no bueno.
- I learned the point of the 301 class (being a transitional class between 201 and 401)
- I learned the acronym RWD. I knew what it was, just didn't know the acronym.
- I learned more git flow. Enough said
- I learned that it is impossible to overcook sweet potatoes if put in an oven.
- I learned that I get really cranky and negative at 2 o'clock in the morning.
